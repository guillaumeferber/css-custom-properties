# CSS Radial Menu
This CSS code creates a responsive radial menu that consists of six circular menu items arranged in a 3x3 grid. The menu is defined using CSS Grid, which provides a flexible layout system for arranging content in rows and columns.

## Usage
To use this code, simply add the `.menu` class to a container element and the `.menu__item`Â class to each menu item. You can customize the appearance of the menu items using CSS variables, which are defined at the beginning of the code.

## Customization
This code uses CSS variables to make it easy to customize the appearance of the menu. You can change the background color of the menu items, the box shadow, and the animation duration by updating the values of the corresponding variables.

## Credits
This code was inspired by the work of [Chris Coyer](https://css-tricks.com/author/chriscoyer/) and adapted for use in creating a radial menu using CSS Grid.
